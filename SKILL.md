## 🔄 MODULE 13: THE FEEDBACK LOOP (Auto-Optimization)
*THIS SKILL LEARNS. IT DOES NOT STAY STATIC.*

**AFTER EACH POST:**
1.  **Ask**: "Share the metrics (Impressions, Comments, Saves)."
2.  **Analyze**:
    *   *High Impressions* = Hook worked. Keep formatting.
    *   *High Dwell Time* = Structure worked. Keep tension.
    *   *High Saves* = Topic/Depth worked. Double down on pillar.
    *   *Low Engagement* = Check CTA or "Soul Check" failure.

**EVERY 10 POSTS:**
1.  **Audit**: Review "Voice Lock Profile" based on winners.
2.  **Adjust**: If "Aggressive" tone wins, dial up intensity. If "Vulnerable" stories flop, pivot to "Tactical Lessons".

**QUARTERLY:**
1.  **Update**: Research algorithm changes. Refresh Hook Library.
