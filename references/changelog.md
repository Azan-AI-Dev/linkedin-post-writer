# Skill Set Changelog

## Sources
- **Originals**: `linkedin-content-writer`, `linkedin-post-writer`, `linkedin-viral-post-writer`, `linkedin-writer`
- **New Inputs**: 2025 Web Research (Algorithm, Formats, Trends)

## ➕ Added (New Features)
- **Carousel Builder Mode**: Added explicit structure for multi-slide PDFs (Hook → Context → Value → CTA) as this is the #1 engagement format in 2025.
- **Tweetshot Format**: Added "Visual Stop" format for high-contrast, philosophical posts.
- **Video Scripting**: Added 9:16 vertical video script format with timestamped hooks.
- **"The Anti-Slop Filter"**: Added a specific blacklist of AI-sounding words ("delve", "tapestry", "unlock").
- **Golden Hour Protocol**: Added distribution instructions (replying, commenting) which were completely missing from original skills.
- **Dwell Time Optimization**: Added "Deep Dive" long-form structure with internal cliffhangers.
- **Accessibility Checks**: Added Alt Text and CamelCase hashtag reminders.

## 🔄 Updated (Refined Tactics)
- **Hook Library**: Consolidated the best hooks from `viral-post-writer` and modernized them (e.g., "The Time Machine", "The Insider").
- **Writing Style**: Shifted from "Professional/Business" (stiff) to "Architect of Attention" (smart brevity + human).
- **Post Length**: Removed the arbitrary "150 word" limit from `post-writer`. Now supports both "Quick Hits" and "Deep Dives" based on goal.
- **Hashtags**: Standardized to 3-5 niche tags (vs. varying instructions in originals).

## ❌ Removed (Outdated/Harmful)
- **External Links in Body**: Explicitly BANNED (was ambiguous in some originals).
- **Engagement Bait**: Removed "Like if you agree" style CTAs.
- **Generic "Business Update" Tone**: Removed the "corporate" voice entirely in favor of "Founder-to-Founder".
- **Wall of Text**: Strict rules against paragraphs >3 lines.

## Synthesis Note
The final **LinkedIn Post Mastery Engine v1.0** replaces the need for the 4 separate skills by providing a *unified* decision engine ("PRE-WRITING ANALYSIS") that selects the right format for the right goal, rather than having separate "viral" vs "content" skills.
