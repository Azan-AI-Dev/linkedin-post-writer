## Synthesis Notes
- **`linkedin-viral-post-writer`** and **`linkedin-writer`** are the most advanced. They share similar DNA (hooks, whitespace, value-first) but approach it differently (`viral` is more strategic/theoretical, `writer` is more template/execution heavy).
- **`linkedin-post-writer`** is a solid middle-ground, adding a research step which is crucial for relevance.
- **`linkedin-content-writer`** is the weakest for "viral" content but useful for strict corporate comms.
- **Missing from all:** Real-time trend integration (beyond generic "research"), specific updated algorithm hacks for late 2024/2025 (e.g., PDF carousel nuances, specific distinct features like collaborative articles), and a unified "Agent Persona" that bridges the gap between "Corporate shill" and "Bro-marketer".
