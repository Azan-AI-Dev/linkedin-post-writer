# Gap Analysis & Opportunity Mapping

## 1. Critical Gaps (Missing Essentials)

| Gap | Why it matters (2025 Research) | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Carousel/PDF Strategy** | Carousels are the **#1 highest engagement format** in 2025. None of the skills provide a specific *framework* for writing carousel slides (just "Infographics" or general mention). | Add a dedicated "Carousel Builder" mode with slide-by-slide structure (Hook Slide → Value Slides → CTA Slide). |
| **Dwell Time Optimization** | Algorithm prioritizes dwell time. Existing skills focus on "hooks" (clicks) but less on *retention* mechanics mid-post. | Add "retention triggers" (internal cliffhangers, "keep reading" loops, visual formatting for scanning). |
| **The "Golden Hour" Protocol** | Early engagement is critical. Skills focus on *writing* but ignore the *distribution* instructions (replying to comments, engaging before posting). | Add a "Post-Publishing Checklist" instructing the user on immediate actions (first 60 mins). |
| **Video Scripting** | Video is #2. No skill has a dedicated "Video Script" format (Hook → Value → CTA for 9:16 vertical video). | Add a "Video Script" format option for short-form (TikTok-style) LinkedIn videos. |
| **Accessibility** | No mention of Alt Text for images/carousels or accessible formatting standards. | Add an "Accessibility Check" (Alt text reminders, camelCase hashtags). |

## 2. Outdated Tactics (To Remove/Update)

| Tactic | Current Status | Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Short Text Only (150 words)** | `linkedin-post-writer` focuses on short posts. Research shows **long-form (text)** is making a comeback for thought leadership (dwell time). | Update length guidelines to allow for "Deep Dive" text posts (800-1200 chars) alongside short ones. |
| **Generic Corporate Tone** | `linkedin-content-writer`'s "business update" style is now suppressed as "low quality/generic". | Deprecate the "corporate" voice in favor of "Human Professional" (even for business updates). |
| **External Links in Body** | Some templates might imply sharing articles. Research confirms this kills reach. | Strict rule: **NO external links in body**. Comments or "Link in bio" thinking only. |
| **Engagement Bait** | "Comment YES" is penalized. | Explicitly ban "lazy" CTAs. Use "thought-provoking questions" instead. |

## 3. Conflicting Instructions

- **Emoji Usage**: `linkedin-post-writer` says "1-3 max". `linkedin-viral-post-writer` says "minimal/authentic". Research supports **functional** emojis (bullets, arrows) but warns against decorative overuse.
    - *Resolution*: Standardize to "Functional Emojis Only" (lists, signposts, vibes) — no "wall of emojis".
- **Hashtags**: `linkedin-post-writer` says 3-5. `linkedin-writer` says "max 3". Research says **3-5 is the sweet spot**, but relevance is key.
    - *Resolution*: Set standard to "3-5 Niche-Specific Hashtags".

## 4. Innovation Opportunities (The "Alpha")

- **The "Anti-AI" Filter**: Since AI detection is high, the new skill should have a specific "Humanizer" pass:
    - Remove "delve", "crucial", "landscape", "tapestry".
    - Insert "warm" language and specific personal anecdotes.
- **The "Comment Generator"**: A mini-skill to help users generate high-value comments on *other* people's posts (to drive traffic back).
- **Format Mixing**: "The Hybrid Post" — e.g., a short text hook that leads into a Carousel or Video.
- **New Formats**:
    - **"The Tweetshot"**: A text post styled like a tweet screenshot (creates a visual stop).
    - **"The Contrarian Data"**: Using data to *disprove* a common belief (combines Data + Hot Take).

## 5. Synthesis Strategy

The Ultimate Skill will be built on the chassis of **`linkedin-writer`** (due to its advanced "Voice DNA" and format selection logic) but upgraded with:
1.  **The "Viral Theory"** from `linkedin-viral-post-writer` (Hook library, 3-act structure).
2.  **The "Research Discipline"** from `linkedin-post-writer`.
3.  **NEW Engines**: Carousel Builder, Video Scripter, and Dwell Time Optimizer.
