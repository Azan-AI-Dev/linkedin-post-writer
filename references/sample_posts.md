# Stress Test: Sample Posts

## Post 1: Career Advice (Story Arc)
**Topic**: Overcoming Imposter Syndrome
**Hook Template**: The Vulnerable ("I almost quit...")

I almost quit my job as a Senior PM yesterday.

I was sitting in a board meeting.
Surrounded by people with 10+ years of experience.
Using words like "strategic synergy" and "Q4 deliverables".

I felt like a fraud.
My heart was racing.
I thought, "They're going to find out I have no idea what I'm doing."

Then my mentor, Sarah, pulled me aside.

She said:
"You're not here because you know everything.
You're here because you ask the questions nobody else is brave enough to ask."

That shifted everything.

I realized imposter syndrome isn't a bug.
It's a feature.
It means you're in a room where you can grow.

If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room.

Have you ever felt like a fraud at work?

## Post 3: Remote Work (Tweetshot)
**Topic**: Async Work
**Hook Template**: The Contrarian ("Everyone says...")

**[Visual: Mock Tweet]**
Stop scheduling "quick syncs".
A 15-minute call is a 30-minute distraction.
Write it down. Send it. Move on.
Async isn't a perk. It's a survival skill.

**[Text Body]**
Everyone says "let's jump on a quick call".

They're destroying your deep work.

I analyzed my calendar last month.
I had 12 "quick syncs".
They cost me 24 hours of flow state.

If you can't write it down, you haven't thought it through.

Async > Sync.

## Post 4: Marketing Strategy (Deep Dive)
**Topic**: The Death of SEO
**Hook Template**: The Data Drop ("I analyzed...")

I analyzed 50 SaaS blogs.
Organic traffic is down 40% across the board.

Here's the uncomfortable truth:
SEO as we know it is dying.

**1. The AI Answer Engine**
Google's AI Overviews are stealing your clicks.
Users get the answer without visiting your site.
Zero-click searches are the new normal.

**2. The Trust Deficit**
People are tired of "10 Best CRM" articles written by robots.
They are moving to Reddit. To communities. To trusted voices.
They want human experience, not keyword stuffing.

**3. The Pivot**
So what do you do?
Stop optimizing for keywords.
Start optimizing for *perspective*.

Be the voice that AI can't replicate.
Share specific data.
Share failure stories.
Share hot takes.

—

The future of content isn't "ranking".
It's "resonating".

PS: I write about this shift in my newsletter (Link in bio).

## Post 5: "Stop Doing X" (Video Script)
**Topic**: Cold Outreach
**Hook Template**: The Contrarian

**(0:00-0:03)**
[Visual: Ripping up a piece of paper]
Stop sending "Just checking in" emails.
It makes you look desperate.

**(0:03-0:15)**
I get 10 of these a day.
"Did you see my last email?"
"Bump."
"Any thoughts?"
Delete. Delete. Delete.

**(0:15-0:45)**
Here is the rule of value.
Every interaction must add value, not just ask for attention.

Instead of "checking in", send this:
"Saw you launched X feature.
Here's a 30-second video on how our tool speeds that up."
Or:
"Here's a competitor analysis I made for you."

**(0:45-0:60)**
Don't ask for their time.
Earn it.
